# My first bigger project

### About Website

I found a design and I wanted to improve my skills on it.  
I'm still working on this, I want to add Dark mode and  
make animations using ES6, without AOS (animation on scroll library).  

---

What I want to improve on my next project is to:

- write more **clean code**

- give a **better structure** to whole project

- use more **JavaScript (ES6)** which I'm still learning.

### Used skills

- HTML5

- CSS3

- SCSS

- JavaScript (ES6, AOS)
